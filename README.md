# Compilation Techniques Lab

## Introduction

The purpose of this laboratory is to write your own implementation of a compiler. The language used throughout the documentation is a simplified version of C, called **AtomC**. The lexical, syntactical and semantical rules are based on the AtomC definition from RÄƒzvan
Aciu's website, which is no longer to be found publicly, only through a [Web Archive snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20220709070356/https://sites.google.com/site/razvanaciu/limbaje-formale-si-tehnici-de-compilare).

The compiling process is split between the ***analysis phase***, which has to do with the code parsing, making sure that the formal language rules are respected, and the ***synthesis phase***, which implies aspects such as code generation and optimization.

Although the phases of a popular compiler are far more advanced than the ones presented in this lab, implementing the requirements below should give you a good grasp on how compilers (and interpreters) do their job.

## Analysis phase

The analysis phase consists of three types of analysis:

1. Lexical analysis
2. Syntactical analysis
3. Semantical analysis
